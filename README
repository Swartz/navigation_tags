= Navigation Tags

Provides hierarchical tree navigation based on Radiant's site structure. Outputs navigation in the form of an unordered list. 
Automatically expands the hierarchy to reveal the current page and its siblings, and sets the class of the <li> for the current page to "current". 

== Usage

  <r:nav [html_id="nav"] [root="/"] [include_root="false"] [depth="2"] [expand_all="true"] [ids_for_lis="true"]/>

  Given this directory tree: 

   * Home
   ** About
   *** Contact Us
   ** Blog
   *** First Article
   *** Second Article
   ** Catalogue
   *** Spam
   *** Ham

  <r:nav /> would output a navigation list like: 

  <ul id="nav">
    <li class="parent_of_current has_children"><a href="/about/">About</a>
      <ul>
        <li class="current"><a href="/about/contact">Contact Us</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class="has_children"><a href="/blog/">Blog</a></li>
    <li class="has_children"><a href="/catalogue">Catalogue</a></li>
  </ul>

  == Available tag attributes:

  * id: 		defaults to "nav", 			becomes the HTML id attribute of the main ul
  * ids_for_lis: 	defaults to false, 			enable this to give each li an id (it's slug)
  * class: 	defaults to none, 			allows to give the ul one or many classes
  * root: 		defaults to "/", 	which page to start building the navigation from
  * include_root: defaults to false, 			set to true to include the root page (i.e. Home)
  * depth: 		defaults to 2,				which will print out the first two levels of pages.
  * expand_all: 	defaults to false, 			enable this to have all li's create sub-ul's of their children, i.o. only the currently active li
